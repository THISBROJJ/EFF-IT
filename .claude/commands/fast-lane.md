# Fast Lane

Skip the interrogation and spec-drafting phases. Takes a plain-language description,
creates a session and branch, then goes straight to orchestration → implementation →
audit → security → PR.

Use this when:
- The ask is already clear and scoped
- You're iterating on something that was already specified
- You want to prototype quickly without a formal spec

---

## Pre-flight

```bash
git status --short
git branch --show-current
```

Must be on `main` with a clean tree. If not, stop and tell the user.

---

## Session setup

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask for a one-sentence description of the work.

Derive `slug` from the description (kebab-case, 2–4 words, type prefix optional).
Generate `run_id`: `YYYYMMDD-HHmm` (UTC).

Create session directory, register the active run, and write the initial checkpoint:

```bash
mkdir -p sessions/<run_id>
echo "<run_id>" > .current_run
```

Detect or prompt for the test command:
- Check for `package.json` with a `"test"` script → `npm test`
- Check for `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` → `pytest -v`
- Check for `Makefile` with a `test` target → `make test`
- Check for `go.mod` → `go test ./...`
- If none found, ask the user: "What command runs your tests? (leave blank to auto-detect later)"

Write the detected/provided value (or null) as `test_command` in the initial checkpoint.json.

`sessions/<run_id>/checkpoint.json`:
```json
{
  "run_id": "<run_id>",
  "slug": "<slug>",
  "started_at": "<ISO8601>",
  "stage": "branch",
  "spec_path": null,
  "plan_path": "sessions/<run_id>/PLAN.md",
  "branch": null,
  "iteration": 0,
  "max_iterations": 5,
  "feature_types": [],
  "test_command": null
}
```

Write a minimal `sessions/<run_id>/SPEC.md` from the description:
```markdown
# <slug>

## Description
<$ARGUMENTS verbatim>

## Acceptance criteria
[GAP: derived from description — orchestrator will expand]
```

---

## Step 1 — Create the feature branch

Spawn the `git-expert` agent:
- Task: create branch `feat/<slug>` from `main` and check it out

Update checkpoint: `"stage": "orchestrate", "branch": "feat/<slug>"`.

---

## Step 2 — Orchestrate

Spawn the `orchestrator` agent:
- Input: `sessions/<run_id>/SPEC.md`, `slug`
- Output: `sessions/<run_id>/PLAN.md`

Update checkpoint: `"stage": "concern"`.

---

## Step 2.5 — Resolve security concerns

Update checkpoint: `"stage": "concern"`.

Spawn the `concern-resolver` agent:
- Input: `run_id`, `spec_path` (`sessions/<run_id>/SPEC.md`)
- Output: `sessions/<run_id>/SECURITY_CONCERNS.md`; updates `feature_types` in checkpoint

Update checkpoint: `"stage": "architect"`.

---

## Step 3 — Architecture draft

Spawn the `architect` agent in Architecture Draft mode (Trigger A):
- Input: `sessions/<run_id>/SPEC.md`, `sessions/<run_id>/PLAN.md`, `slug`
- Output: `sessions/<run_id>/ARCHITECTURE.md`

Initialize the session progress log `sessions/<run_id>/PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`:
```
# Progress — <slug>
Started: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>
Spec: sessions/<run_id>/SPEC.md
Plan: sessions/<run_id>/PLAN.md
```

Update checkpoint: `"stage": "implement"`.

---

## Step 4 — Implementation loop

Invoke the `implementation-loop` command:
- Input: `sessions/<run_id>/PLAN.md`, `sessions/<run_id>/SPEC.md`, `run_id`, `max_iterations=5`

Update checkpoint: `"stage": "audit"`.

---

## Step 5 — Completion audit

Spawn the `karen` agent with `sessions/<run_id>/SPEC.md` as the original ask.

| Karen verdict | Action |
|---|---|
| PASS | Continue to Step 6 |
| PARTIAL or FAIL | Append punch list to `sessions/<run_id>/PLAN.md`; return to Step 4 |

Update checkpoint: `"stage": "security"`.

---

## Step 6 — Security review

Spawn the `security-reviewer` agent.

| Result | Action |
|---|---|
| PASS | Continue to Step 7 |
| FINDINGS | Append remediation tasks to `sessions/<run_id>/PLAN.md`; return to Step 4 |

Update checkpoint: `"stage": "git"`.

---

## Step 7 — Git wrap-up

Spawn the `git-expert` agent:
- Commit, push, open PR against `main`

Update checkpoint: `"stage": "done"`. Clear the active run marker:

```bash
rm -f .current_run
```
